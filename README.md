# Ember-cli-inject-asset-map

This has no customizations right now, but I intend to update whenever possible to allow the world to use this. This injects an AssetMapController into your app with access to content of assetMap.json your Brocfile produces (generateAssetMap: true). This is useful if you are computing image paths that are fingerprinted.
